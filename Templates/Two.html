  <!--CSS can be added to the header in a style element.
  Selection includes all h1 tags and applys the syling property color red to them.
  Ideally you should use hex codes for colors-->
    <!--You can include multiple styling properties in the same selection. You can select multiple tags.
    Selection includes all h2 and h3 tags and applys color and underline properties as well
    as specifies the font family, start with Arial, if that's not available use Helvetica,
    and finally if neither are available in the browser use an sans-serif.-->
      <!--You can utilize the class attribute to creat a style element. You can then assign
      these classes in the body. The standard is .camelCase to indiciate a class-->
        <!--You can utilize an id to create a CSS rule that targets an element. IDs must be
        unique in the document. The rule default is #cameCase like the #firstPargraph.-->

  <!--With psuedo class selectors you can target the first of type to style the first
  paragraph even if it happens to change. Or you can target all even rows.
  Psuedo class selectors always begin with a single or double colon.-->
    <!--Pseudo classes are also helpful when writing styles based on an elements state.
    For instance change the color of links to green on hover.-->
      <!--Pseudo elements can be used to target a portion of an element such as the first letter
      of a paragraph or the first line.-->

  <!--The smaller the number the larger the heading size. This is default format in the browser.

  begins on a new line.-->

  down to a single white space character. -->

  <!--The break tag ends the line you are currently on and resumes on the next line. No closing tag required.-->

  class you separate them with a space.-->

  <!--This is an example of a paragraph with an id.-->
  <!--Text will automatically wrap if it reaches the right side of the browser or the user resizes it will
  be adjusted by a process called browser reflow. You can use wbr to indicate where a good place to
  add a line break in the paragraph would be.-->

  <!--blockquote is used to capture quoted text optionally attributed to a source.-->
  <!--default browser style for blockquote is indented.-->
